Hey! Thank you for downloading the "Gold Rush" asset pack.


> This pack is an ongoing project that I will be adding content to over time if we meet certain milestones, 
  but if you've got any good suggestions for things to be added let me know.

> Please refer to the licence included in files for the pack if you want to know about commerical/non-commerical use, etc.

> If you really like the pack, consider rating it on Itch.io and/or leaving a comment. 
  It lets me know people want more/like the pack lol.

> The pack should (hopefully) be pretty straight-foward for use, but if you've got any questions feel free to ask me in the comments.


Lastly, a big thank you again for downloading.
